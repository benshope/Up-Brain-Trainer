Zen-Back
========

This app is a cross-platform mobile app written with Cordova.  My goal is to make a minimalist, friendly space for a user to perform and track their n-back exercise performance.

N-back is a mental exercise/game that improves working memory (short term memory) and fluid intelligence.  This is important because with about 25 minutes of rigorous training a day, healthy adults can make a real impact on their mental capacities.  N-back exercises are not just some game like Lumosity.  These exercises have the potential to make a real impact on people's lives.
